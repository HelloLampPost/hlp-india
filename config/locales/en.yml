  more_information: "More Information"
  more_information_text_1: "If you look closely, most street objects have a manufacturer or maintenance reference code on them. These codes are used by operators to distinguish one object from another."
  more_information_text_2: "Hello Lamp Post gives a new use to these existing codes by allowing localised conversations in public spaces."
  more_information_text_3: "You can have a chat with many objects - including buildings and taxis."
  more_information_text_4: "The interaction takes the form of a conversation. The objects are curious about the world they find themselves in and want to ask you questions about it. The response they receive are then shared with other players meaning an object understands the personality and people of the local area."
  more_information_text_5: "Conversations can be started from any device by opening Facebook Messenger and searching for \"@HelloIndia\". It’s free to play and suitable for all ages!"
